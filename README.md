# RGB2CMYK
 There are two different models for colours: additive (i.e., light) and subtractive (i.e., paint). The additive primaries are Red (R) , Green (G) and Blue (B). The subtractive primaries are Cyan (C), Magenta (M), and Yellow (Y). The three subtractive primares are supposed to make perfect black when mixed together in equal amounts. However, since black paint is generally cheaper than mixing the three primaries, we also consider black (K for key) as a subtractive primary. The RGB system is used for computer monitors, while the CMYK system is ised for colour printers. In order to produce comparable result based on on-screen designs, we need a reliable mappiing between the two systems. Surprisingly, such a mapping is rather hard to find. This project will explore this.
